Explain why we need a DataBase Management System (DBMS) instead of a spreadsheet?

Every person or company do not need the Database Management System. Because, if the data are not need to circulate much in our working, do not have a lot of data to manage or are not important to who are reached the specific data then we may need to DBMS.

 Different between database management system and classic excell sheet:

    -  Using database management system, we prevent the data to multiply unnecessarily, and so we gain the extra memory.
    -  Through the database management system, we prevent the data to repeat.
    -  Using DBMS allow us to hold the data in an order.
    -  Using DBMS allow us to reach a specific data in large data.
    -  We can give the data access we want to the people we prefer.
    -  DBMS help to save the data safely. Data containing vital information is much safer thanks to this system, and anyone without access permission  cannot obtain this information.

 For these reasons, we might need to use DBMS.

I contacted with my chif in my internship, but he dosen't have much time so  I cannot answer the other two question.
